What is Shebang in shell script?
Because shebang specifies the shell interpreter that will run the script. 
However, you can explicitly specify the shell to run the script, but in this case the shebang line will be ignored. How does shebang work? 
When you use shebang in the first line of a script, you are telling the shell to run the script using the specified command.



$? -The exit status of the last command executed.
 $0 -The filename of the current script. 
 $# -The number of arguments supplied to a script. 
 $$ -The process number of the current shell. For shell scripts, this is the process ID under which they are executing.
 
 $@ stands for “all the arguments to the script”. If your shell script was invoked as Then $@ will be “foo bar”. 
 As a general rule, when you use $@ in a script, you should always quote it. This will preserve the original layout of the arguments even if there are spaces in one or more arguments.
